#Cognitive technologies overview.

Mainly cognitive technologies are based on:

 1. Program operatable knowledge bases
 1. Computer vision
 1. Voice recognition
 1. Machine understanding

Overall, it is the set of technologies that helps or creates machine understanding.
Main focus of current seminar are technologies that could be useful in our AS department everyday life.

## Goal

Imagine we want to do something clever, all the repetitive actions that we do automation.
We do reporting, we do some forms every day filling in, for example business trip reporting and forms, all this could be done by our machines.

## Knowledge bases

Complete list could be found on this [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonsense_knowledge_bases).

Mainly those KB-s are:

 1. Facts and links structure
 1. Storage mechanism
 1. Web service, possibly

As they use different ideas for all of the items above they do not have common structure and common mechanisms to retrieve the data.

### [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/)

WolframAlpha is most popular at the moment and is used in [Siri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri_(software)).

We can spend some time to experiment with WolframAlpha:

 1. Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
 1. first American to orbit the Earth
 1. first Russian to orbit the Earth
 1. current weather in kazan
 1. what is Firefox?
 1. to get Rid of

This is main magical force of Siri and similar.

### [Evi](http://www.evi.com)

Same game with questions and answers. WolframAlpha wins, but Firefox example is most important for us and it fails.

### [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/)

This is mainly the dictionary of english words with synonyms and morphology.

Let's try some words:

 1. software
 1. browser

This is really good in searching for synonyms.

## Voice recognition
